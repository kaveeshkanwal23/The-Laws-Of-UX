# The-Laws-Of-UX
Design better product &amp; services using the laws of UX as per human psychology. 

# Introduction
Any design must be human-centered, i,e instead of forcing people to accept a design or an experience, we can use certain laws of human pschycology to design products to which humans are already adapted. Now, this does not mean that you cannot propose a radically different design, but that design must be extensively beta tested before a formal lauch to your larger customer base. But for most cases, it is good to stick to human-centered design.

# Jacob's Law
- Stick to familiar patterns(for eg; navigation, kist view, search, pagination etc) as people have mental models from past UX using different products.
- Understand the mental models of users by creating - user personas, journey maps, conducting user interviews etc.
- User persona generally has 3 parts - Basic Info(name, age, profession etc), details(personas goals), and insignts(direct quotes from the personas).

# Fitts's Law
- Time to acquire a target (eg; a button, combo box etc) is a function of distance to and size of the target.
- Touch targets should be large eough for user to easily distinguish them.
- There must be ample spacing between touch targets.
- Touch targets must be placed in ares which can be easily acquired by the user i,e reachability.
- Distance that a user must travel to acquire the target must be minimum. For eg; have the submit button just next to the i/p fields so that the distance the user travels is minimal.

# Hick's Law (V IMP)
- Show only what is required to be shown to the user at a particular time. Redunduncy and excessiveness create nothing but confusion, it reduces the ability of people to easily and quickly accomplish their task. 
- Break complex tasks into smaller steps to reduce cognitive load. Congnitive load is the amount of mental resources required to understand an interact with an UI.
- Reduce or eliminate things which are not required by the use to complete a particular task.
- As cognitive load increses, the task abandanment by the users also increase.
- Progressively(step by step) introduce new feature so that users do not become overwhlemed.
- The entire idea here is to reduce the mental strain of the user and give him a pleasurable experience while interacting with the UI.
- Make sure that we do not oversimplify too much leading to the point of abstraction. 

# Miller's Law: 
- A user can generally keep 7 (+-2) items in its working memory. 
- Make sure to organize content into smaller chunks so that user can process, memorize and understand it. 
- Chunking: Structuring content into visually distinct group with clear hierarchy so that it can be comprehended easily. 

# Postel's Law
- Be conservative what you show, be liberal in what you accept from the users. 
- Be conservative in how much information you need the users to provide. 
- Users want to feel they're in control. Unnecessary info required from the user must be avoided. 
- A design must be open to extension without changing the whole design. One must only progressively add elemts to a design so that users do not get overwhelmed.
