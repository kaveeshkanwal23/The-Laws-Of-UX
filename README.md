# The-Laws-Of-UX
Design better product &amp; services using the laws of UX as per human psychology. 

#Introduction
Any design must be human-centered, i,e instead of forcing people to accept a design or an experience, we can use certain laws of human pschycology to design products to which humans are already adapted. Now, this does not mean that you cannot propose a radically different design, but that design must be extensively beta tested before a formal lauch to your larger customer base. But for most cases, it is good to stick to human-centered design.

#Jacob's Law
- Stick to familiar patterns(for eg; navigation, kist view, search, pagination etc) as people have mental models from past UX using different products.
- Understand the mental models of users by creating - user personas, journey maps, conducting user ibterviews etc.
- User persona generally has 3 parts - Basic Info(name, age, profession etc), details(personas goals), and insignts(direct quotes from the personas).

# Fitts's Law
- Time to acquire a target (eg; a button, combo box etc) is a function of distance to and size of the target.
- Touch targets should be large eough for user to easily distinguish them.
- There must be ample spacing between touch targets.
- Touch targets must be placed in ares which can be easily acquired by the user i,e reachability.
- Distance that a user must travel to acquire the target must be minimum. For eg; have the submit button just next to the i/p fields so that the distance the user travels is minimal.
